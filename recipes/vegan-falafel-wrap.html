    <p>Mediterrean food is one of the <em>easiest</em> cuisines to modify to a plant-based diet! With the cuisine rich in vegetables and legumes such as peppers and chickpeas, all you need to do is spice to your liking.</p>
    <p>The reason I <strong>love mediterrean food are their vast colors implemented in food</strong>, so that is what we are going to do now!</p>

    <p>Here are the ingredients you will need to make the vegan falafel wrap (serves 2)</p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>vegan seeded wraps, try to read the ingredients that it does not include palm oil</li>
            <li>premade falafel box, over baked</li>
            <li>medium avocado (1)</li>
            <li>medium red pepper (1)</li>
            <li>medium red onion (1)</li>
            <li>iceberg lettuce (1/2)</li>
            <li>lime (1)</li>
            <li>roma tomatoes (2)</li>
            <li>vegan tzatziki (100g)</li>

            <li>basmati rice (.5 cups)</li>

            <li>sriracha (optional but highly recommended!)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Here comes the fun part! Putting it all together.</p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180 C, if you're using fan. If you're using regular, bump up to 200C</li>
            <li>Preheat all the vegetable oil in a pan on medium heat.</li>
            <li>Mince your red onion and red pepper and toss it into the pan once the oil is hot.</li>
            <li>While the onion and red peppers are cooking, put the premade falafel into an oven safe tray and put in the oven for 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, mash the avocado and add salt to your liking.</li>
            <li>Chop up the tomatoes,iceberg lettuce, and lime to squeeze to add as a fresh add on the last part of the process</li>
            <li>Add in the premade rice into the onion and peppers and adding in the dried parsley. Cook until rice is warmed up. Leave on low heat.</li>
            <li>Take two slices of the violife cheese and place them on the wrap, chucking into the oven for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once you take out the wraps and falafel, assemble to your liking! Don't forget to add sriracha for taste.</li>
        </ol>
