        <p>If you're like me, I was <strong>never the biggest fan of seafood.</strong> Let me be clear, it was <em>the texture, not the taste.</em></p>
        <p>Japanese cuisine, given it's geographical location is full of fish, but <strong>luckily there is a way to still enjoy the art of rolling nori while being plant-based.</strong></p>

        <p>Below is how I get my fill on little taste of Japan (serves 2)</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>pack of Nori</li>
                <li>sushi rice (50g)</li>
                <li>teriyaki Tofu (1/2 pack)</li>
                <li>cucumber (1/4)</li>
                <li>medium orange pepper (1) </li>
                <li>medium avocado (1)</li>
                <li>bamboo sushi roller</li>
                <li>soy sauce</li>
                <li>vegetable oil (25 mL)</li>
                <li>salt to taste</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    
        <p>Lets get rolling!</p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook the sushi rice on a medium to high heat for 10 minutes, it should have a sticky consistency once the water has evaporated.</li>
                <li>Preheat all the vegetable oil in a pan on medium heat.</li>
                <li>Slice your tofu into 10 equal parts and place into the oiled pan when hot</li>
                <li>Chop your pepper and cucumber so they are matchstick size and length</li>
                <li>In a bowl, mash the avocado and add salt to your liking.</li>
                <li>Take tofu off of the heat once they receive a brown side to them.</li>
                <li>On your bamboo sushi roller, place a sheet of nori shiny side down.</li>
                <li>When the sushi rice cools, spoon onto the nori leaving 1/4 inch left on all sides.</li>
                <li>Spoon some of the mashed avocado ontop of the rice.</li>
                <li>Add in 5 slices of the tofu onto the roll.</li>
                <li>Add in the matchstick cucumber and peppers.</li>
                <li>Once all your ingredients are in, gently wet the opposite edge of the nori.</li>
                <li>Using your bamboo mat, gently roll and squeeze slightly as you go.</li>
                <li>Leave in the fridge for 5 minutes to set</li>
                <li>Slice and serve with soy sauce!</li>
            </ol>
