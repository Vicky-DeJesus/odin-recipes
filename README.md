# odin-recipes

<!-- Recap at the end of the project, self-reflection, skills demonstrated, etc-->

# This project is based off of my time in London. As someone new to the plant based diet, finding restaurants and the willingness to go through the reservation process was tough but I was determined. I eventually came up with a few recipes of my own while living here that were quick go-tos.

# In this project, my main goal was to familiarize myself with git and terminal and then HTML structure. Familiarizing myself with the commands and seeing how horrendous logs were in the beginning to where they are now (still mess up from time to time) was a great reward. When it came to HTML, seeing a website come to life was a delight. Successfully creating pages and adjusting text styles for accessibility were challenging to be enthusiastic on a page, but it got easier as I went on. 

# I have other ideas for this site that I want to continue as I advance, coming back with CSS knowledge to fully flesh out this idea.
